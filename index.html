                            First and foremost, I love writing code. Ever since, writing my first program in C and manipulating it to produce a desired output. I have been obsessed with the idea of using software to solve practical problems. Software Engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving. I believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the lives of people around the world. [I want to be like Elon Musk, WHY? Because, I just love his ideas and the technology he uses to make Earth a better place].
                            Earlier I used to think how does a computer works? Is it Magic? Sounds funny, right? But, majority of humans, in their childhood have thought the same like me. But when I started digging deep into the knowledge about computers', I concluded, "Programming is Magic", because when you write a program you encounter with a tremendous amount of bugs and you know how to put-on the magic of programming into the code. "You create it, You fix it"...
                            Being a software engineer, I love to do projects a lot. whether it is a personal or a professional project. It helps me to develop more practical knowledge and what I am lacking and how to overcome those situations. As a Programmer, I need to have patience, as you encounter with variety of bugs and to fix them you need to have a good amount of patience.
